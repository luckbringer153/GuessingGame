      <h1>The Tale of Io</h1>

      <section class="mainTextAndImg">
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            This is an abriged version of the Greek myth of Io. Long ago, Zeus
            had yet again grown restless and searched the earth for another love
            of his life. He found Io, a beautiful maiden working in the fields.
            Zeus flew down to meet with Io and created an enormous storm cloud
            in an attempt to obscure them from his wife, Hera. However, Hera
            knew when to be suspicious of her huzband and flew down to punish
            him. Zeus had just enough time to transform Io into a cow as white
            as snow in order to protect her from Hera's wrath. When Hera
            arrived, she could tell that Io was a transformed human; she cajoled
            Zeus to give her the cow as a present. Once alone with the cow, Hera
            set her servant, the giant named Argus Panoptes, to guard Io and
            prevent Zeus from retrieving her. Argus was perfect for the task -
            his entire body was covered in 100 eyes! By rotating which eyes were
            "sleeping" (closed), the giant could keep watch from every angle at
            all times.
          </p>

          <p>
            Zeus was in a pickle. In desperation, he reached out to Hermes for
            help, who was happy to assist. To succeed, Hermes planned to
            approach Argus while disguised as a shephard. He brought his
            panpipes with him so that he could put the giant to sleep with its
            music. The next day, Hermes approached Argus the giant...
          </p>

          <h4>
            Hermes must lull all 100 of the giant's eyes to sleep with his
            music. How many of Argus' eyes were open when Hermes arrived?
          </h4>
